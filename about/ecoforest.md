# üèûÔ∏è EcoForest

Welcome to EcoForest ‚Äì our shared commitment to the environment, represented both in the digital realm and the real world. This is a testament to the collective efforts of our community to mitigate climate change.

By donating to the NGOs featured in the EcoHub, you forever engrave your name onto the blockchain and in the real world, awarding you a tree NFT, which tracks your cumulative donations and the real world impact you've produced. And yes, it provides you with in-game bonuses as well!

Each tree within EcoForest carries a narrative - a story of a player, their engagement with our games, and their contribution towards real-world environmental conservation. These trees, symbolized as NFTs, immortalize your role in our collective effort, etching your name onto the blockchain.

EcoForest is a living chronicle of our united impact. Here, you can witness the number of trees we've collectively planted, their geographical locations, and the volume of carbon dioxide we've helped neutralize.

Your engagement with our games does more than provide a thrilling virtual experience; it contributes to the expansion of our real-world forest.

However, EcoLand and EcoForest extend beyond gaming. Even if you prefer not to participate in our games, you can directly contribute to our environmental cause by donating coins. These contributions go directly towards growing EcoForest and sustaining our shared environment.
