{% hint style="success" %}
It's more than just a game;

it's gaming with conscience.
{% endhint %}

While each game in our portfolio presents unique mechanics to cater to a diverse player base, they all share a common commitment to addressing the mentioned issues:

<details>

<summary><strong>Steep learning curves</strong></summary>

Common in-game mechanics that players already know, polished and refined to bring an amazing, authentic and new gaming experience!

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Lack of sustainable economies in blockchain games</strong></summary>

Constantly releasing new content and new games to mitigate a huge scarcity that would lead to an expensive entry fee for new players.

The game economy built around veterans and long-term players, not new players, to avoid early demand.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Limited player base due to a steep technical learning curve, as wallets and linking</strong></summary>

All games will follow a freemium business model, available to everyone from the start.\
\
Interacting with blockchain is optional and not mandatory.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Expensive entry fees</strong></summary>

It's free! Everyone can play for free and never pay a single cent.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Lack of REAL WORLD IMPACT</strong></summary>

Through our EcoHub, the players can get in-game valuable assets while also donating to environmental-oriented NGOs.
