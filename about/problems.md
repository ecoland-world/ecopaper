# ðŸŸ¥ Problems

Our platform comes as a solution to multiple problems with current blockchain games.

<details>

<summary><strong>Steep learning curves</strong></summary>

Many blockchain-based games have complex mechanics that can be challenging for new or casual players to understand.\
\
The learning curve can be steep, with players needing to understand not only traditional game mechanics but also the intricacies of blockchain, crypto assets, and more.\
\
This can deter potential players and limit the appeal of these games.

<details>

<summary><strong>Lack of sustainable economies in blockchain games</strong></summary>

Many blockchain-based games struggle to maintain a sustainable in-game economy. The value of assets and in-game currencies can fluctuate wildly, leading to inflation, asset devaluation, and unstable gameplay experience.\
\
This makes it difficult for players to make long-term decisions, as the potential value of their assets and the viability of their strategies can change unpredictably.

<details>

<summary><strong>Limited player base due to a steep technical learning curve, as wallets and linking</strong></summary>

Apart from understanding game mechanics, players also need to navigate the technicalities of setting up and managing crypto wallets, linking them to games, and handling digital assets securely.\
\
This complexity can intimidate less technically adept players, limiting the playerbase and restricting the widespread adoption of blockchain gaming.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Expensive entry fees</strong></summary>

Entry into the world of blockchain gaming can be prohibitively expensive for many players.\
\
High transaction fees, initial investments in NFTs or digital assets, and the costs associated with maintaining a crypto wallet can add up.\
\
This makes it challenging for players with limited resources to enjoy the full range of experiences offered by blockchain games, and limits the games' potential audience.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Lack of REAL WORLD IMPACT</strong></summary>

Despite the potential of blockchain games to generate substantial economic activity, their impact is often confined to the virtual world.\
\
Players spend significant time and resources in these games, but this investment rarely translates into tangible real-world benefits or improvements.\
\
The lack of a meaningful, positive impact outside of the game world can limit the overall appeal and societal value of these games.
