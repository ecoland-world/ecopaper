# ðŸŽ® What is ECO

### What is Eco

Welcome to the heart of EcoLand â€“ EcoHub, our interconnected Ecosystem. Here, all our games come together under the shared umbrella of $ECO, our universal cryptocurrency.

The $ECO coin, the lifeblood of our ecosystem, is integrated into every game within EcoHub. It provides a seamless currency for transactions, in-game purchases and rewards, offering a cohesive economic experience across all our diverse games.

Accompanying $ECO is our collection of unique NFTs. These assets enhance gameplay and hold real-world value, allowing for player ownership and trade. The real magic? These NFTs are cross-game compatible. Any NFT you acquire in one game can be utilized across all games within EcoLand, extending its value and usability.

We understand the world of blockchain can seem intimidating. To cater to all players, we've developed the EcoLander Pass. This special feature unlocks the blockchain elements of EcoLand for those interested in engaging with them. This includes features like the blockchain marketplace, quests awarding $ECO, and access to special blockchain-integrated areas.

Yet, if you prefer a more traditional gaming experience, you're free to enjoy EcoLand without any blockchain interactions. You can dive into the variety of games, join the thriving social community, and progress in your in-game adventures without the need to manage any blockchain components.

With each new game introduced into the ecosystem, the value of $ECO and the demand for NFTs grow. This ensures a dynamic, evolving environment that offers rewarding experiences for all players.

Beyond being a vibrant gaming community, our ecosystem also stands as a platform for real-world impact. Your actions in-game contribute not only to your own progress, but also to our broader mission of environmental sustainability.
