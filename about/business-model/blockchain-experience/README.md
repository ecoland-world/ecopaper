**2. Staking Mechanism:**

In EcoLand, staking operates through two distinctive models:

* **Staking for $ECO:**
  * **How it Works:** Players lock a minimum of 10,000 $ECO tokens for durations ranging from 30 to 365 days, accruing daily rewards and exclusive NFTs.
  * **Benefits for Players:** Enhanced earning potential, access to unique assets, deeper engagement, and participation in governance.
  * **Benefits for EcoLand:** Stability through token holding, increased user retention, and vibrant community engagement.
* **Staking for NFT Rewards:**
  * **Unique Approach:** Players lock $ECO to earn unique NFTs, different from the standard threshold rewards.
  * **Benefits:** Similar to staking for $ECO, this model supports economic stability, user retention, and community engagement.
* **Considerations for Future:**
  * Options like Staking Pools, NFT Staking, Partner Staking, and Event-Based Staking are under consideration for future implementation to diversify staking rewards and engagement.

**3. Yield Farming:**

EcoLand introduces an innovative economic layer through Yield Farming.

* **How it Works:** Players contribute $ECO to liquidity pools, earning a share of transaction fees and bonus rewards based on their contributions.
* **Benefits:** This initiative enhances player engagement while fostering a self-sustaining economy within EcoLand.

**4. The EcoHub Marketplace:**

EcoHub acts as the central marketplace within the EcoLand gaming universe, supporting transactions exclusively with $ECO and soft-currencies.

* **Exclusive Access:** Available only to Ecoland Pass holders, the marketplace offers a range of NFTs, including vanity items and gameplay-related assets, with transactions being limited by player level to maintain game balance and fairness.

**5. Land Ownership & Taxation:**

Land in EcoLand, represented as NFTs, offers unique ownership and revenue-generation opportunities.

* **Ownership & Taxation:** Landowners receive a percentage of all expenditures by plot owners in both $ECO and HC (converted to $ECO), fostering an incentive structure for land ownership and investment in the game.

**6. NFT Battlepass:**

The Battlepass, available as an NFT for Ecoland Pass holders, offers a unique, non-expiring progression system, available for purchase at any time and completable at the player’s own pace.

* **Pricing & Availability:** Initially priced at $10 in $ECO, the limited supply might lead to price variations in the marketplace.

**7. NFT Lootboxes:**

EcoLand features Gacha mechanics, offering players randomized NFT rewards from different lootboxes of varying rarities and values.
