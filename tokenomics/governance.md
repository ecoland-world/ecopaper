# üèõÔ∏è Governance

In our commitment to a truly community-driven ecosystem, we at EcoLand have established our Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). This is our means to ensure that you, our dedicated and valued players, have a direct influence on the shaping of EcoLand.

Guided by our DAO, our 'Council of Elders' is nominated and elected by you, the stakers of our ECO token. This council is the voice of our community in key discussions and decision-making processes, keeping EcoLand evolving in alignment with your needs and desires.

The scope of DAO governance covers several pivotal aspects of EcoLand:

1. Council of Elders Configuration: You have a say in defining the structure, roles, and responsibilities of the council that represents you.
2. Marketplace Fees: You control the cost of transactions within the EcoLand marketplace.
3. Tree Planting Initiatives: You contribute to our environmental efforts, deciding how we organize and carry out our tree-planting initiatives.
4. Economic Balance: You participate in maintaining a fair and stable in-game economy, influencing crucial economic decisions.
5. New Games Development: You have a stake in the future of EcoLand, deciding on the development of new games within our ecosystem.
6. Additionally, our DAO includes a unique grants system. Those who voluntarily contribute to the project's development can be recognized and rewarded for their efforts.

All proposals within the DAO follow a 'Timelock' period, providing a 48-hour window for community review before any changes take effect.

Our DAO embodies the essence of EcoLand: a player-driven platform where every voice matters. It's your world. It's your game. Your voice counts here in EcoLand.
