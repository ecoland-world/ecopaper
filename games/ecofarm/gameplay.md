# 🎮 Gameplay

EcoFarm is the first game launched within EcoLand, drawing inspiration from popular farming games.

Players can own and manage their farm, cultivate crops, raise animals, and trade farm-related items.

Here, players can:

● Plant, grow, and harvest crops and trees.

● Raise and care for animals.

● Upgrade their farm with buildings and decor.

● Create, join or interact with other players in farming cooperatives.&#x20;

● Play a true freemium experience.

EcoLander Pass owners get also the possibility to interact with Web3 features:

● A dedicated mine where $ECO can be mined

● Quests that award $ECO

● NFT trading, breeding and rewards

**Controls**

EcoFarm offers both a third-person and top-down camera perspective. Players interact with the game world using an interaction key, where the tile that they are on opens different possibilities based on the tile you are on, from interacting with a building, watering a tree or planting a crop.

**Survival**

EcoFarm has a survival aspect, where players have to monitor their food and energy bars. Depleted food bars hinder energy regeneration, and depleted energy bars restrict players from performing energy-consuming actions.

**Trading**

Trading plays a vital role in the game's economy. Players can sell their produce in the market for in-game currency, which they can use to purchase various items and upgrades. For EcoLander pass holders, trading extends to blockchain marketplace transactions, further enriching their gameplay experience.
