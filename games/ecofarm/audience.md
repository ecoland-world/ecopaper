EcoLand targets a wide range of players, from casual gamers who enjoy farming simulations to blockchain enthusiasts eager to explore a game with robust blockchain integrations. It also targets the increasingly growing demographic of players interested in NFTs and digital ownership.

The first game that will be launched, Ecofarm, will directly target casual players, passionate about farming games, maintaining a ranch, and having short sessions with significant impact.

The people attracted by the ownership that blockchain provides will be able to enjoy the amazing farming experience while also earning $ECO and NTFs rewards, proportional to their thinking and actions as an investor, but also hugely proportional to the time investment in the game in developing their farm, allowing them to produce even more rewards.
